# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation
Predicting tumor regions from brain MRI Images 

The dataset used for the project :
https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

The dataset dosen't contain masks so I used Labelbox for creating groundtruth data, the masks are stored in mask_links.csv and Mask_processing.ipynb can be used to parse the csv file and save it to your directory.
